// Exercise 19-2: Create a client and server that talk 
// to each other. Have the client send messages typed 
// by the user and the server respond autonomously. 
// For example, you could use String parsing techniques 
// to reverse the words sent by the client. Client: 
// "How are you?" Server: "You are how?"
