// Exercise 19-3: Go back and rewrite the therapy client
// to use <code>clientEvent()</code> rather than 
// client.available() in draw(). This is trickier than 
// it might initially seem because it requires the use 
// of readStringUntil('\n') to guarantee we read the 
// full String when the message is completed rather 
// than one character at a time.
