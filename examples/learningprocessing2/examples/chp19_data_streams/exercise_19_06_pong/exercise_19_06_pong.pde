// Exercise 19-5: Create a two-player game of Pong 
// played over the network. This is a complex assignment, 
// so build it up slowly. For instance, you should get 
// Pong to work first without networking (if you are 
// stuck, an example is provided at the book's web site). 
// You will also need to make changes to the server; 
// specifically, the server will need to assign the 
// players a paddle as they connect (left or right).
