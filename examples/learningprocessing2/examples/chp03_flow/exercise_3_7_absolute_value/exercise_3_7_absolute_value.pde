// Exercise 3-7: The formula for calculating the speed of 
// the mouse's horizontal motion is the absolute value 
// of the difference between mouseX and pmouseX. The 
// absolute value of a number is defined as that number 
// without its sign:

/*
- The absolute value of –2 is 2.
- The absolute value of 2 is 2.

In Processing, we can get the absolute value of the number by placing it inside the abs( ) function, that is,
- abs(-5) → 5

The speed at which the mouse is moving is therefore:
- abs( mouseX - pmouseX )

Update Exercise 3-7 so that the faster the user moves the 
mouse, the wider the drawn line. Hint: look up 
strokeWeight( ) in the Processing reference.
