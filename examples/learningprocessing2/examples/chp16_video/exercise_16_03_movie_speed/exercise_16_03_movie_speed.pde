// Exercise 16-3: Using the speed() method in the Movie class, write a program 
// where the user can control the playback speed of a movie with the mouse. 
// Note speed() takes one argument and multiplies the movie playback rate by 
// that value. Multiplying by 0.5 will cause the movie to play half as fast, 
// by 2, twice as fast, by -2, twice as fast in reverse, and so on.
