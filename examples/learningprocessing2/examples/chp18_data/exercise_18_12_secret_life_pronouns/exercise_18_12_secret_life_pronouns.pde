// In James W. Pennebaker's book </em>The Secret Life of Pronouns<em>, 
// Pennebaker describes his research into how the frequency of words that 
// have little to no meaning on their own (I, you, they, a, an, the, etc.) 
// are a window into the emotional state or personality of an author or 
// speaker.  For example, heavy use of the pronoun “I” is an indicator of 
// “depression, stress or insecurity”.  Create a Processing sketch that 
// analyzes your use of pronouns across a body of text.  For more, visit
