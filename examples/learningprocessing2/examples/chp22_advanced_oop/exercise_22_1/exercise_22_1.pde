// Exercise 22-1: Continuing with the Car example from our discussion of encapsulation, how would you design a system of classes for vehicles (that is, cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles)? What variables and functions would you include in a parent class? And what would be added or overridden in the child classes? What if you wanted to include planes, trains, and boats in this example as well? Diagram it, modeled after Figure 22.1 .
