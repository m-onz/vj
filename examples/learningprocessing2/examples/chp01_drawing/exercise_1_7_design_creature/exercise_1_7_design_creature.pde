// Exercise 1-7: Design a creature using simple shapes 
// and colors. Draw the creature by hand using only 
// points, lines, rectangles, and ellipses. Then attempt 
// to write the code for the creature, using the Processing 
// commands covered in this chapter: point(), lines(), 
// rect(), ellipse(), stroke(), and fill(). 
// In the next chapter, you will have a chance to test 
// your results by running your code in Processing.
