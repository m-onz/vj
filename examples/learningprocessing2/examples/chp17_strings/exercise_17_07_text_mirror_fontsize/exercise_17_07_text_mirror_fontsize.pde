// Exercise 17-7: Create a video text mosaic where each letter is colored white, 
// but the size of each letter is determined by a pixel's brightness. 
// The brighter the pixel, the bigger it is. Here is a little bit of code from the 
// inside of the pixel loop (with some blank spots) to get you started.

/*
 float b = brightness(video.pixels[i + j*video.width]);
 float fontSize = ____ * (_____ / _____);
 textSize(fontSize);
